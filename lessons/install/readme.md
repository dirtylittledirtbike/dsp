# Install software on your computer


### Install [git](http://git-scm.com/).

You have it installed if you can run `git --version` at the command
line and get output like `git version 2.13.5`.

Macbooks have git pre-installed.


### Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

Please install the **3.x version** (or the most recent version).

There are two things you can verify to check your install.

First, from the command line, all of the following should start up
some kind of Python interpreter:

```bash
python3
ipython3
jupyter notebook
spyder
```

Second, inside any of those Python interpreters, you should be able to
do all of these without error:

```python
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import pandas
import statsmodels
import sklearn
```

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac

### Q1. Python Version 2 or 3

**Course material for the bootcamp is compatible with Python versions 2.7 and 3.0. All HackerRank Python pre-work is configured for Python 3 only.  Therefore, Python 3 is the recommended version.**  

Did you install Python 2 or 3? Why?  

>> >I have python 2.7 (preinstalled on mac) and then I installed python 3.8 to do a udemy course, but realized different libraries like tensorflow etc require or work better with different versions of python so now I just use virtual environments depending on whatever it is im trying to do, but my base environment is 3.7.4 which works pretty well with most things. 

### Q2. Which Python Version Installed   

In the Terminal:

`python3 --version`

>> inside my base environment (automatically activates when opening terminal) 3.7.4 otherwise 3.8.1
