[Think Stats Chapter 9 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2010.html#toc90) (resampling)

#### 0utputs from different models:

Resample p-vlaue for preg_length: 0.175<br>
Permutation p-value for preg_length: 0.174<br><br>

Resample p-vlaue for birth_weight: 0.0<br>
Permutation p-value for birth_weight: 0.0<br>

#### Conclusion:
The p-values do not seem to vary much between the two approaches. <br>
The choice of the model does not seem to effect the results in a significant way, <br>
at least in the case of pvalues between different groups in this dataset. <br>
